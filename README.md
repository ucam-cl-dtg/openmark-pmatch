# openmark-pmatch
This is a subsection of the Java implementation of The Open University's [OpenMark](http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/) project.
In particular, this is the PMatch helper class and its dependencies for marking free-text answers.

The complete source code for the Java implementation of the project, as of 2012, can be found [here](https://github.com/gmfawcett/openmark-mvn).

This repository is likely only to be necessary temporarily as an effort is being made to move OpenMark to [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenMark/openmark) in the future.

We intend on using PMatch for supporting free-text answers on [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/) and that will be done, in part, so that we are able to collaborate with some of the Open University's research.
