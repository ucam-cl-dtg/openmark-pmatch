# openmark-pmatch
This is a subsection of the Java implementation of The Open University's [OpenMark](http://www.open.ac.uk/openmarkexamples/) project.
In particular, this is the PMatch helper class and its dependencies for marking free-text answers.

As we understand the situation, the main development of OpenMark has moved to PHP for its Moodle integration, but there also exists a Java implementation which we are interested in. The complete source code for the Java implementation of the project, as of 2012, can be found [here](https://github.com/gmfawcett/openmark-mvn).
Hopefully this particular repository will only temporarily be necessary, because work is being made toward getting the whole of the latest Java OpenMark source code on GitHub. At which point, we would be happy to help getting the built artefacts onto Maven Central.

We intend on using PMatch for supporting free-text answers on [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/) and that will be done, in part, so that we are able to collaborate with some of the Open University's research.
